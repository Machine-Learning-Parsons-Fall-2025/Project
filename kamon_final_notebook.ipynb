    "I am/was interested in studying Japanese <i>Mon</i>. <i>Mon</i> (aka kamon, or monsho - I use <i>kamon</i>, which is the specific term for family crest, in this report) are crests used to identify individuals, families, and institutions in Japan. Famous examples of these crests can be found in the Warring States period (Sengoku Jidai): in modern Japan, notable and popular figures from this period can be identified from their <i>mon</i> alone.\n",

    "Examples of their historical use can be found in historic paintings, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara#/media/File:Sekigaharascreen.jpg\">Battle of Sekigahara</a>, as depicted below:\n",

    "<i>Mon</i> can be seen in battle flags carried by soldiers across this scene. I'm interested in historical Japan, and know some <i>mon</i> by sight myself, so I was interested in a project where I could spend even more time lookin at these crests.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Mon</i> are made up of different shapes and symbols, which carry meaning (although this is not something I explore in this project). <i>Mon</i> can be classified into five categories: plants, animals, objects, "
