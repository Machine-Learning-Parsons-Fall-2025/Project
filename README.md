## Ideas:
![/Kamon_Example.jpg](Kamon Example - Toyotomi Clan)
**Japanese Kamon**:
- How does an untrained/unfamiliar person view Kamon?
- Japanese crests/emblem (Kamon) representing individuals or families (historically)
- Kamon have consistent structure and no color, and are made of shared motifts/symbols
  - kamon are traditionally classified by type (plant, animal, nature, tool, vehicle, building, etc)
  - motifs have specific meaning, and some are more popular than others
- A kamon dataset is ripe for machine learning techniques!
- pipe dream: enrich image dataset with historical/geographic context
  - example datasets:
    - Scrape here: https://kamondb.com/letter/45/
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bachrr/mon-white-224
    - https://huggingface.co/datasets/kenthorvath/japanese-kamons

**Revolutionary Faces**

- How did artists depict eyes (or more generally, fatial features) in the post-revolutionary period of American History?
- Sense/extract facial features from revolutionary portraits -> unsupervised learning? 
- Building on a revolutionary period dataset used in MSDV Major Studio 1 (full dataset not linked here)
  - subset here: https://github.com/nmolnar-parsons/revperiod_portraitfaces


**Something to do with mapping**
- not sure what this would be yet, but I like maps/geographical data 11/7/25
